● What is Emmet?
--> It is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT and other strudtured code formates via content 
    assist.
--> It is independent from text editor. It only provides facility to text editor.
--> It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.

● Difference between a Library and Framework?
--> Library - "It just takes minnimum efforts to put inside our code."
            - A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is 
              reused repeatedly. 
            - It is essentially a set of pre-defined functions and classes that programmers can use to simplify their work and speed up the development process. 
            - So, developers do not have to write code to accomplish specific functionality because the library already includes code for those functionalities. 
              Standard libraries are available with most programming languages, but programmers can also make their own custom libraries.
              
--> Framework - Developers need not start from scratch when they have tools to assist them like Frameworks.
              - A framework is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. It includes reusable pieces of code written 
                to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality. 
              - The framework may include defined and undefined objects and functions that developers can use to create applications. 
              - In that way, we can add significant functionality to the system by using existing code around the structure. 

● What is CDN? Why do we use it?
--> CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network.
--> A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.
--> CDNs improve content delivery speed, reduce latency, enhance user experience, ensure global availability, and offer scalability and security benefits. 
    These advantages make CDNs an essential component of modern web infrastructure, particularly for websites, streaming platforms, and other content-heavy 
    applications.
    
● Why is React known as React?
--> The name "React" reflects the reactive nature of the library. In traditional web development, when data changes, developers typically have to manually 
    update the DOM (Document Object Model) to reflect those changes. This process can be complex and inefficient, especially for large and dynamic applications.
--> React introduced a new approach by using a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, and React uses it to efficiently 
    determine and apply the minimal set of updates needed to reflect changes in the data. This approach allows React to optimize the rendering process,
    resulting in improved performance.
--> The concept of reacting to data changes and efficiently updating the UI is what gave rise to the name "React." It emphasizes the library's ability to 
    efficiently handle state changes and automatically update the UI components, making it easier for developers to build interactive and responsive user 
    interfaces.
    
● What is crossorigin in script tag?
--> The crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used to specify how the browser should handle cross-origin requests when fetching an external JavaScript 
    file. Cross-origin requests occur when a web page tries to access resources (such as scripts, stylesheets, or images) from a different domain, protocol, 
    or port than the one it originated from.
--> When including an external JavaScript file using the <script> tag, you can use the crossorigin attribute to control how the browser should handle the loading 
    of the script and whether it should enforce cross-origin security policies.

● What is diference between React and ReactDOM
--> React is the core library for building UI components and managing their state, while ReactDOM is a package that facilitates the rendering of those React 
    components into the browser's DOM. ReactDOM works closely with React to update the actual DOM efficiently based on the changes in the virtual DOM.
--> React is core library and ReactDOM is used for doing browser related stuff. 

● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
--> When developing a React application, it is common to use the development version (react.development.js) to take advantage of the additional debugging 
    capabilities and detailed error messages. However, when deploying the application to a production environment, it is recommended to use the production 
    version (react.production.js) for its smaller size and optimized performance.

● What is async and defer?
--> When we load the web page then there are two major things happening in our browser:
    1) HTML parsing
    2) Loading of the script  --> It contains two parts, i) fetching the script from the network and
                                                        ii) executing script line by line
